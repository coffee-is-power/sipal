# sipal: your amazing 3D pencil :pencil2:!
sipal is 'lapis' but in reverse, which means pencil in portuguese,

This library can render **3D shapes** using **only the CPU**, and it's written **100% in rust**.
## Embedded systems
With a little bit of tweaking, this **can** be used in embedded systems, the drawing is done by the **Context** and windowing and input by the **Window** trait, which you'll need to implement.

## Features
- Draw triangles :heavy_check_mark:
- Depth buffer :heavy_check_mark:
- Runs on embedded devices :construction_worker_woman:

Other features are on their way to be implemented, there's still a LOT to do yet, but we'll get there!
## Examples
### Cube
This is a example of a spinning cube, nothing special, but considering I only took about 4 days to implement the library and this example, it's pretty amazing!
